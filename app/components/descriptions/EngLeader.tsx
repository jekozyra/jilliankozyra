                I like upskilling and professionalising engineering orgs, with
                an eye towards quality hiring, collaboration, code quality,
                documentation, and speed of iteration. I feel very strongly
                about small, stacked PRs.
            </div>
            <div>
                I have led teams from 2-6 engineers and am comfortable designing
                hiring processes, building teams, developing roadmaps, and
                delivering feedback.

                I like upskilling and professionalising engineering orgs, with
                an eye towards quality hiring, collaboration, code quality,
                documentation, and speed of iteration. I feel very strongly
                about small, stacked PRs.

            <div>
                I have led teams from of varying sizes and am comfortable
                designing hiring processes, building teams from scratch,
                developing roadmaps, and delivering feedback.
